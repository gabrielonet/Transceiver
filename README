Depends on : kivy 1.10 framework 
Si5351 Adafruit RF signal generator
DS17xx Real time clock
Adafruit ADC converter
Adafruit DAC converter
SotaBeam Vari audio DSP module

Working :
CW speed (potentiometer tight to one of ADC converter, and a child process as keyer)
Tx is keyed by reed relay controlled by keyer app
_______________________________________

Not working yet ! : 
Rit Tx , Rit Rx  , Tx listen
Frequency manual dialpad
Computer contesting interfacing
keyer delay to allow relays to switch on prior to effective transmit (full break)

Remarks :
Only 1 GPIO left available, in the future I will need a GPIO extender
In order to avoid Si5351 crosstalking, I made a separate Xtall BFO. In the future will use a secondary Si5351 ontop of arduino
nano and controlled by Raspberry Pi depending of CW / USB filters (Cw filter shape is shifted up to 1khz,
so instead of 9 mhz USB / LSB , for CW I need  9.001 BFO)
